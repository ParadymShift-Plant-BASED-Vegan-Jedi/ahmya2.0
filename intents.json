However, instead of being left to die or being taken to the slaughterhouse, the chickens were rescued by a group of animal rights activists who happened to be driving by. \n\nThe activists, from a group called \"Direct Action Everywhere,\" worked quickly to free the chickens from their cages and transport them to a local animal sanctuary. Despite being covered in blood and suffering from injuries sustained in the accident, most of the chickens survived and were able to live out the rest of their lives in safety and comfort.\n\nThe incident drew attention to the cruelty of factory farming practices and the suffering that animals endure in the meat industry. It also highlighted the importance of animal rights activism and the power of individuals to make a difference in the lives of animals.\n\nThe rescued chickens became known as the \"Highway 20 Chickens\" and their story inspired many people to take action to improve the lives of farmed animals. The incident serves as a reminder that every animal deserves to be treated with kindness and compassion, and that even small acts of kindness can have a big impact!"]
